* Minimalistic game made using Unity Game Engine
* Language: C#

### Motive

The primary motive was to enhance my programming skills in C# and Object-Orientation. Since most games mostly derive from Unity and Unreal Engine, I wanted to understand how programming a simple game would work within the Unity environment. Learning the concepts of working the Unity Software, as well as learning the C# syntax as well as conducting basic mathematics were all crucial elements I gained after developing this simplistic game.

:black_small_square: Microsoft Visual Studios 2019 Community --version 16.5+
:black_small_square: Visual Studio Code 1.43.1+

#### Program Anatomy
* Basically I implemented an MVC, however with game development everything had to be compartmentalized. Fonts, Scripts, Objects all had to be categorized in particular folders. Refer to image.
