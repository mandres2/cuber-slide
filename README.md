* Minimalistic game made using Unity Game Engine
* Language: C#
* Web Deployment: JavaScript/CSS/HTML

### Motive

The primary motive was to enhance my programming skills in C# and Object-Orientation. Since most games mostly derive from Unity and Unreal Engine, I wanted to understand how programming a simple game would work within the Unity environment. Learning the concepts of working the Unity game engine, as well understanding the C# syntax and logic were all crucial elements gained after developing Cuber Slider.

### Demo

* 3 Levels Currently Established in the Game

#### Program Anatomy
* Basically I implemented an MVC, however with game development everything had to be compartmentalized. Fonts, Scripts, Objects all had to be categorized in particular folders. Refer to image.
